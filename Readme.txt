To execute the Hate Speech Detection Model, please use a Jupyter Notebook. The libraries and frameworks
should import as expected upon the first execution. Please allow some time for this operation to
complete.

Download the folder and execute locally.

The CSV files should remain in the same folder as the model.

The model is stored in the 'Hate Speech Detection Model.ipynb' file.
